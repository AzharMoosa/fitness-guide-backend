The slower one moves the arms from side to side the harder the exercise becomes working the abdomen that much better. When moving ones arms during the exercise it is crucial to not stop between repetitions or else one will lose the effect of working the abdomen. As with all exercise consistent breathing in and out during the exercise is important as one must ensure proper oxygen flow.",
